FretCoach is an AI-powered learning ecosystem that transforms how musicians practice. It provides real-time evaluation and adaptive visual feedback—not through audio effects like distortion or delay, but through learning effects.

The system listens to your playing, evaluating pitch accuracy, scale adherence, timing stability, and note transitions. This performance data is instantly translated into ambient lighting cues that act as subconscious training signals, allowing your brain to self-correct in real-time—much like how traditional pedals shape tone, FretCoach shapes technique.

The ecosystem functions in three modes: a feature-rich desktop app for deep practice sessions, a portable hardware pedal for on-the-go training, and a web dashboard for tracking long-term progress. Practice anywhere, progress everywhere.

Beyond real-time feedback, FretCoach acts as an autonomous coach. It identifies learning bottlenecks and uses AI to customize future training strategies. It transforms unstructured jamming into a guided loop with tangible feedback. While designed for guitar, the system adapts to any instrument or vocal training that benefits from embodied learning.
