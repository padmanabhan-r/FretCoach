# Introduction to FretCoach

## Real-Time AI Coaching for Guitar

FretCoach is an AI-powered guitar training system that provides instant feedback during practice. It analyzes your playing in real-time, tracks performance across four key metrics (pitch accuracy, scale conformity, timing stability, noise control), and delivers feedback through multiple channels:

- **On-screen visualizations** — Live metrics and performance scoring
- **AI coach commentary** — Real-time verbal guidance
- **Ambient lighting** — Color-coded visual feedback

Think of it as having a professional coach watching every practice session—providing instant feedback, tracking progress, and adapting guidance to your strengths and weaknesses.

## The Problem with Solo Practice

When practicing alone, you can't tell if you're:
- Playing notes out of tune
- Rushing or dragging the beat
- Hitting wrong notes
- Creating unwanted string noise
- Actually improving

Without immediate feedback, you reinforce both good and bad habits equally. By the time you get feedback (from a teacher, recording, or performance), you've already practiced the mistake hundreds of times.

Professional musicians have coaches who provide real-time guidance. FretCoach makes that available for every practice session.

## The FretCoach Solution

FretCoach provides instant feedback through three channels:

### 1. Visual Feedback
Real-time metrics on screen:
- **Pitch Accuracy** — Note accuracy
- **Scale Conformity** — Scale adherence
- **Timing Stability** — Rhythm consistency
- **Noise Control** — String noise detection

Color-coded indicators show performance at a glance.

### 2. AI Coach (Vocal Feedback)
Real-time **spoken** coaching using GPT-4o-mini-TTS:
- *"Your timing is drifting—lock in with the beat."*
- *"Pitch accuracy is solid—focus on reducing string noise."*
- *"You're rushing between strings. Slow down."*

Text is generated by GPT-4o-mini, then converted to natural speech and played during practice. Specific, actionable feedback as you play.

### 3. Ambient Lighting
Smart bulbs reflect performance:
- 🟢 **Green** — Strong performance
- 🟡 **Yellow** — Minor issues
- 🔴 **Red** — Needs work

Visual cues without breaking focus.

## How FretCoach Accelerates Learning

Traditional practice:
```
Practice → Wait hours/days → Get feedback → Try to remember → Repeat
```

FretCoach:
```
Play note → Instant analysis → Immediate feedback → Adjust → Next note
```

### The Dual-Brain Architecture

FretCoach combines two complementary systems to deliver both speed and intelligence.

![FretCoach Brain Architecture](../images/FretCoach%20Brain.png)

**Audio Analysis Agent (Fast Loop - Deterministic)**
- Real-time processing with <150ms latency
- Continuous monitoring of pitch, scale, timing, and noise
- Immediate visual feedback and ambient lighting
- Runs entirely locally (no cloud required)

**AI Coach (Slow Loop - LLM-Powered)**
- Intelligent pattern recognition and guidance
- Verbal coaching with personalized recommendations
- Practice plan generation based on history
- Uses cloud LLMs when needed (Gemini, GPT-4o-mini)

This separation ensures **instant feedback for motor learning** while leveraging **AI intelligence for strategic guidance**.

### Why Instant Feedback Works

**Catch mistakes early**
Address errors on the first occurrence, not after hundreds of repetitions.

**Immediate reinforcement**
FretCoach delivers feedback within 150ms—fast enough to influence motor learning in real-time.

**Multi-sensory engagement**
Visual, auditory, and peripheral feedback channels work together.

**Objective tracking**
Data shows exactly which metrics improve and by how much.

## The Ecosystem

FretCoach consists of three connected components that work together seamlessly through a central database.

![FretCoach Trifecta](../images/FretCoach%20Trifecta.jpeg)

### FretCoach Studio (Desktop Application)
Desktop app for focused practice. Connects via USB audio interface, analyzes in real-time, displays metrics, and provides AI coaching.

**When to use:** Dedicated practice sessions

### FretCoach Portable (Raspberry Pi Device)
Raspberry Pi 5 device with the same analysis engine. Supports Manual and AI modes, syncs automatically.

**When to use:** Practice anywhere without a laptop

### FretCoach Hub (Web Platform)
Web analytics platform. Review sessions, chat with AI coach, generate practice plans, track progress.

**When to use:** Planning and reviewing

All three components share a **central database** (PostgreSQL via Supabase), enabling:
- Seamless practice tracking across devices
- AI coach access to your complete practice history
- Cross-device practice plan sync

## What Makes FretCoach Different

**Not a learning app** — Doesn't teach you *what* to play, but helps you play it *correctly*.

**Not a recording tool** — Doesn't just capture performance, it analyzes and coaches.

**Not a tuner** — Evaluates full technique (pitch, timing, scale, noise), not just string tuning.

**It's a practice coach** — Analyzes playing, identifies weaknesses, guides improvement in real-time.

---

## Current Focus: Scales

The current implementation focuses on **scale practice**—the foundational building blocks of music. Every great solo, improvisation, and melodic phrase is built from scales.

Supported scales:
- Major/Minor Diatonic (7 notes)
- Major/Minor Pentatonic (5 notes)
- All 12 keys

FretCoach ensures you're playing the right notes, in time, with clean technique—building the muscle memory that every guitarist needs.

---

## Future Vision

FretCoach is built for guitar. The architecture could potentially extend to other instruments (vocals, bass, drums) or motor skills where real-time feedback improves learning—but that's a future vision.

Current focus: making guitar practice more effective through instant, AI-powered feedback.
