      "\n",
      "1. **Foundational language** – Many areas of mathematics (calculus, differential equations, statistics, optimization) rely on linear algebra for their core ideas.  \n",
      "2. **Computational engine** – Modern computing libraries (NumPy, MATLAB, R, etc.) are built around matrix operations; fast linear algebra underlies machine learning, scientific simulation, and data analysis.  \n",
      "3. **Modeling power** – Linear models are the first step in approximating more complex phenomena (non‑linear, time‑varying, stochastic).  \n",
      "4. **Geometry and physics** – Rotations, reflections, and other symmetries are linear; quantum mechanics and relativity both employ vector spaces and linear operators\n",
