FretCoach is designed as a split-brain learning system.
The left hemisphere operates as a deterministic, always-on audio analysis agent that provides immediate, subconscious feedback during play.
The right hemisphere functions as a reflective AI coach, using LLM reasoning to analyze session-level patterns, generate personalized practice routines, and deliver contextual coaching insights.
This separation allows FretCoach to close the feedback loop in milliseconds while still benefiting from deep AI-driven learning over time.
