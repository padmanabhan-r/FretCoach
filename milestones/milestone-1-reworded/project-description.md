FretCoach is an AI-powered guitar practice system designed to close the feedback loop during learning.
When practicing alone, guitar players often don’t realize they are rushing the beat, playing out of tune, or reinforcing bad technique-leading to slow progress and ingrained mistakes. FretCoach solves this by providing instant, in-the-moment feedback while the player is actually practicing.

The system listens to the live guitar signal and analyzes performance in real time across four dimensions: pitch accuracy, scale conformity, timing stability, and noise control. Instead of showing delayed reports, FretCoach delivers immediate feedback through on-screen visualizations, spoken AI coaching cues, and ambient smart lighting, allowing players to self-correct instinctively without breaking their practice flow. This shifts learning from delayed correction to immediate prevention.

FretCoach is built as a connected learning ecosystem:

A desktop application for focused practice with real-time metrics, live AI coaching, ambient feedback, and automatic session logging

A portable Raspberry Pi–based device, similar to a guitar pedal, that runs the same analysis engine at the edge for practice anywhere

A web dashboard that aggregates session data, tracks progress over time, and generates personalized practice recommendations

Think of it as having a professional coach watching every practice session-providing real-time guidance, tracking progress across sessions, and adapting training based on the player’s strengths and weaknesses.

While FretCoach is designed specifically for guitar players, the underlying approach-closing the feedback loop in milliseconds through real-time AI feedback-can be extended to other instruments, vocal training, and other skill-based activities such as sports and physical training, where immediate feedback helps prevent incorrect practice.

The vision is to make effective practice embodied, measurable, and sustainable-like having a coach with you every time you practice.
