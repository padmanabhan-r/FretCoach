# FretCoach — Master Your Scales. Master the Guitar.

> **"Scales are the vegetables of guitar practice. We make them taste like candy."**

## 🎸 The Pitch
**FretCoach is the first AI practice tool dedicated to making scale mastery addictive.** We all know we *should* practice scales—they are the DNA of every great solo. But let's be honest: running up and down the neck is boring, lonely, and frustrating. You don't know if your timing is off, if you're buzzing the strings, or if that one note was actually a semitone flat.

**FretCoach changes the game.** It listens to your scale runs in real-time and provides instant, millisecond-level feedback. It gamifies the grind, turning your daily warm-up into a high-score chase where perfect technique is the only way to win.

## 🚫 The Problem: "The Robot Trap"
When practicing scales alone, most guitarists fall into three traps:
1.  ** mindless repetition:** Playing fast but sloppy to "get it over with."
2.  **"Invisible" Mistakes:** Your ear misses small timing slips that a pro teacher would catch instantly.
3.  **Boredom:** There is no dopamine hit for playing a C Major scale correctly... until now.

## ⚡ The Solution: The "FretCoach" Loop
We replaced the metronome with an intelligent feedback loop that engages your eyes, ears, and brain.

### 1. It Listens (The Audio Engine)
Our edge-based AI analyzes every single note of your scale run for:
* **Pitch Accuracy:** Did you bend that note slightly sharp?
* **Scale Conformity:** Did you hit a "forbidden" note outside the key?
* **Attack & Release:** are you letting notes bleed into each other?

### 2. It Visualizes (The Heatmap)
Forget standard sheet music. FretCoach highlights the fretboard on-screen:
* **Green:** Perfect pitch & timing.
* **Yellow:** You're rushing the beat.
* **Red:** Wrong note or fret buzz detected.

### 3. It Coaches (The Voice)
Instead of a beep, you get a coach:
> *"You're rushing the transition from the G to B string. Slow it down by 5 BPM and try again."*

## 🛠️ How It Works (The Tech)
FretCoach is a "Learning Ecosystem" designed to follow you from your bedroom to the backstage.
