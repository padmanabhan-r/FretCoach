# Project Name:
## FretCoach — AI-Powered Adaptive Guitar Training

### Description

FretCoach is an AI-powered learning system designed to unlock subconscious motor skills. By listening to your playing and translating performance metrics into immediate ambient lighting feedback, FretCoach allows you to self-correct instinctively—without stopping to read or analyze. This keeps your practice fluid, physical, and engaging.

### The Learning Ecosystem

- **Desktop App** — Deep-dive practice sessions at home with real-time audio analysis, live AI coaching, and ambient lighting feedback.
- **Portable Pedal** — A Raspberry Pi-powered device for on-the-go training, running the same analysis engine at the edge.
- **Web Dashboard** — AI coaching insights, performance analytics, and practice plan generation accessible from anywhere.

### Why FretCoach?

FretCoach transforms unstructured noodling into a consistent, measurable learning loop. Progress comes from practice—and FretCoach makes every session count by providing real-time feedback that trains your brain while you play.

Finally master the skill you've been putting off. Make learning embodied and sustainable.
