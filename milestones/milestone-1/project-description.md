# Project Name:
## FretCoach — AI-Powered Adaptive Guitar Training

### Description

FretCoach is an AI practice system that trains guitarists on **scales**—the fundamental building blocks of all music. Scales are patterns of notes that form the foundation for melodies, solos, and improvisation. Every song you've ever heard is built from scales. Mastering them is like learning the alphabet before writing sentences.

The system listens to every note you play, analyzes your technique in real-time, and delivers instant feedback through three channels: on-screen metrics, spoken AI coaching, and ambient room lighting that shifts from red to green based on performance quality.

### What We're Training

| Skill | What It Means | The Outcome |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Fretboard Navigation** | Knowing where to place fingers to produce specific notes | Players can find any note instantly without looking—like touch typing |
| **Muscle Memory** | Training hands to move correctly without conscious thought | Fluid, automatic playing that frees the mind to focus on expression |
| **Ear Training** | Recognizing whether notes sound "right" within a musical context | Ability to detect and self-correct mistakes in real-time |
| **Rhythmic Precision** | Playing notes at consistent, steady intervals | Music that sounds professional and is easy for others to play along with |

**The end goal:** A guitarist who has internalized scales can improvise freely, learn new songs faster, and play confidently in any musical situation. Scales are the vocabulary; FretCoach teaches you to speak fluently.

### The Learning Ecosystem

- **Desktop App** — Primary training environment with real-time audio analysis, live AI coaching during sessions, visual performance metrics, and ambient lighting feedback.
- **Portable Device** — A Raspberry Pi-powered pedal with integrated audio I/O, running the same analysis engine. Practice anywhere without a computer.
- **Web Dashboard** — Review past sessions, visualize progress trends, chat with the AI coach, and generate personalized practice plans.

### Why FretCoach?

Traditional practice is blind—you play, but without a teacher present, you can't tell what's wrong. Mistakes repeat until they become habits. Progress feels slow and unmeasurable.

FretCoach closes this feedback loop. Every note is evaluated. Every mistake is flagged instantly. The AI adapts your training based on your specific weaknesses. Progress is quantified and visible.

**The result:** Faster skill development, fewer bad habits, and the confidence that comes from measurable improvement.
