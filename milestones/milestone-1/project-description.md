# FretCoach

We all know the struggle: You buy a guitar, you promise to practice regularly, but practicing alone is frustrating. You don't know if you're rushing the beat, buzzing the strings, or playing out of tune - so you reinforce bad habits.

Enter **FretCoach**. We built a system that finally closes the feedback loop. FretCoach listens to your guitar signal and analyzes it across four dimensions: pitch, scale conformity, timing, and cleanliness. It doesn't just show you a graph; it speaks to you like a real coach (*'You're rushing the beat!'*) and uses ambient smart lights to give you subconscious, peripheral feedback. Whether you're at your desk or using our portable Raspberry Pi pedal, FretCoach makes sure every minute of practice actually counts.

### The Learning Ecosystem

1. **Desktop App** - The primary training environment with real time audio analysis, live AI coaching feedback during sessions, on-screen performance metrics, ambient lighting control, and session logging.
2. **Portable Device** - A Raspberry Pi-powered device (like a guitar pedal) running the same analysis engine at the edge, enabling practice anywhere with full AI coaching capabilities.
3. **Web Dashboard** - Cloud based analytics platform to review sessions, chat with the AI coach, generate practice plans, and track progress over time.

Finally master the skill you've been putting off. Turn your resolutions into a reality. Make learning embodied, measurable, and sustainable.

> Don't just practice until you get it right. Practice until you can't get it wrong.
